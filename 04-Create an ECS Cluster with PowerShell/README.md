## Learning Objectives

* In AWS Fargate, you first need to create a "cluster" in ECS
* A "cluster" in AWS Fargate is simply a logical entity for you to deploy containers to.
  * It is NOT an actual cluster of virtual machines or processes
* The cluster entity is leftover from ECS prior to Fargate's existence. Fargate utilizes the same deployment model.
